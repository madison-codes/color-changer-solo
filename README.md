Color Changer project for Mod-1 Madison Kerndt


Description

This is a simple web application with two prominent buttons the 'random' button and the 'reset' button. Each button functions to create a simple, yet fun and interactive game for the users.


Functionality

The 'random' button generates a string of 6 number and letter values. this generated number is then used as the HEX value for the color of the background of the page. The value is pushed, via the .css JQuery function, to set background-color value of the body element of the CSS style. Every click of the random number button triggers the generation of a new HEX value.

The reset button will return the game to the default background-color of white. It is important to note, that the HEX value of the background-color will never be equal to #ffffff and therefore will never appear as white.

A user is able to toggle their button presses between to get their fill of the multitude of colors HEX can provides.
